Functional programming is a paradigm that I enjoy using but that everyone needs to understand some concepts in js in order to carry out effective programming.
I explain them here And given good examples in order to make you understand them.
Higher-order functions: Functions that can take other functions as arguments or return functions as results.
Pure functions: Functions that always return the same output for the same input and have no side effects.
Immutability: Avoiding the modification of existing values and instead creating new values when changes are needed.
Recursion: A function that calls itself to solve a problem, often used as an alternative to iteration.
Function composition: Combining multiple functions to create a new function.
